# Theory of Computation

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What is theory of computation?**
    - Understanding what can be computed
    - Analyzing computational complexity
    - Proving limits of computation
    - "Proofgrammers" combine *proofs* and *programming*

# Key Terms

## Tractable
- A problem that can be solved in **polynomial time** (efficiently).  
- Example: Searching a list of documents.  

## Intractable
- A problem that is solvable, but only with **exponential time** algorithms.  
- Becomes impractical for large inputs.  

## Uncomputable
- A problem that **cannot** be solved by any algorithm.  
- Example: The Halting Problem.

# How It Relates to Search Engines

- **Markdown search engine = tractable problem**  
  - Keyword search can be solved in polynomial time.  
  - Scales efficiently with number of documents.  

- **Intractable examples**  
  - Perfectly understanding "meaning" of text or answering open-ended questions.  

- **Uncomputable examples**  
  - Determining whether an arbitrary program will halt (not related to search).

# Example: Markdown Search Engine

```python
# markdown_search.py

def search_documents(query, documents):
    """
    Return list of documents that contain the query string.
    """
    results = []
    for i, doc in enumerate(documents, start=1):
        if query.lower() in doc.lower():
            results.append(f"Document {i}")
    return results


# Example usage
docs = [
    "# Title One\nThis is a sample markdown document about computation.",
    "# Title Two\nThis file talks about search engines and algorithms.",
    "# Title Three\nComputation theory includes tractable problems."
]

query = "computation"
print("Searching for:", query)
print("Results:", search_documents(query, docs))
