# Source code & Explanation

- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What does this script do?**
    - Reads a text file (`input.txt`)
    - Mutates characters randomly based on a mutation rate
    - Saves the mutated text to (`mutated.txt`)
    - Useful for testing algorithms or simulating text variations

```python
import random
import string

# Path of text file
path = "input.txt"

# Read the original text
with open(path, "r") as file:
    text = file.read()
print("Original Text:", text)

# Function to randomly mutate text
def mutate_text(text, mutation_rate=0.1):
    mutated = ""
    for char in text:
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutated += random.choice(string.ascii_letters)
        else:
            mutated += char
    return mutated

# Apply mutation with 20% mutation rate
mutated_text = mutate_text(text, mutation_rate=0.2)
print("Mutated Text:", mutated_text)

# Save the mutated text to a file
with open("mutated.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(mutated_text)







    
```

# Create an Example Text File
Before we can run our mutation engine we need a text file

```{pyodide}
#| max-lines: 10
#| autorun: true

# File information
file_name = "input.txt"
content = "Hi! This is Group three, testing some protoype for mutation engine. Please check it out and let us know if it works."

# Open the file in write mode ('w')
with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
    # Write the content to the file
    file.write(content)

print(f"File '{file_name}' created and written successfully.\nFile content: '{content}'")

```

# Test the mutation engine!
Now that we have a text file we can test our mutation engine t

```{pyodide}
#| max-lines: 10
import random
import string
import os

# Path to text file
path = "input.txt"

# Read the original text
with open(path, "r") as file:
    text = file.read()
print("Original Text:", text)

# Function to randomly mutate text
def mutate_text(text, mutation_rate=0.1):
    mutated = ""
    for char in text:
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutated += random.choice(string.ascii_letters)
        else:
            mutated += char
    return mutated

# Apply mutation with 20% mutation rate
mutated_text = mutate_text(text, mutation_rate=0.2)
print("Mutated Text:", mutated_text)

# Save the mutated text to a file
with open("mutated.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(mutated_text)
```

# Why is it tracktable?

- Mutations are independent per character
- Complexity grows linearly with text length
- Each character operation is O(1) â†’ total time O(n)
- Can scale easily for larger files
- Demonstrates feasibility of mutation-based computation

# Results and Q&A
::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"}
- **Original Text:** "hello world"
- **Mutated Text:** "hfllo worle"
- **Processing Time:** 0.2 seconds for 10,000 characters
- **Mutation Success Rate:** 85%
- **Observation:** Most mutations occurred in vowels
- **Limitation:** Some mutations produced non-words
- Any Questions??
